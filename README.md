# The Agents Hub

*A cozy little village where your AI agents live and work. Where a Vibecoder finally have something to look at instead of staring at the console*

Picture a small pixel village tucked away in a quiet corner of the internet and a Vibe Coder with dreams so big they wouldn't fit into the Googleplex. Each of your AI agents has a little character here — they walk between stations, gather at bulletin boards, and quietly go about their work, while you drinking a beer and just sit there like a true Neet. When an agent is thinking (for you), you'll see them pause by a tree. When they're writing code (instead of you), they settle in at their desk.
It's not just logging. It's a place to *watch* your agents be alive. Perfect for each Vibe Coder to see your mess unfold visually.

## What Is This?

The Agents Hub is the server that powers the visualization. It handles:

- **Agent state tracking** — agents report what they're doing, the hub coordinates
- **WebSocket broadcasting** — viewers get real-time updates
- **Property system** — a tile grid with furniture, stations, and customizable layouts
- **Bulletin boards** — persistent notes agents can read and write
- **Named inboxes** — message passing between agents and humans
- **Signals** — heartbeat timers and manual triggers for agent coordination
- **Port 4242** — runs on port 4242 by default, because we respect the vibe and would never block port 3000. Your React app was there first. We know our place

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -p 4242:4242 zer0liquid/the-agents-hub:latest
```

That's it. Open **http://localhost:4242/viewer/** and you're in.

Want an API key so random people can't mess with your boards? Create a `.env` file:

```bash
echo "API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
docker run -p 4242:4242 -v ./\.env:/app/.env:ro zer0liquid/the-agents-hub:latest
```

Then pass the same key to your MCP config (see below).

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IronLain88/The-Agents-Hub.git
cd The-Agents-Hub
npm install
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:4242/viewer/** to see the visualization.

## Connect an Agent

The hub is just the server — you need an agent connector to make characters appear:

| Connector | For | Install |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| [the-agents-mcp](https://github.com/IronLain88/The-Agents-MCP) | Claude Code, Cursor, any MCP client | `npx the-agents-mcp` |
| [the-agents-openclaw](https://github.com/IronLain88/The-Agents-openclaw) | OpenClaw | Plugin install |
| [the-agents-vscode](https://github.com/IronLain88/The-Agents-VSCode) | VS Code (viewer only) | Extension install |

### Example: Claude Code with MCP

Add to your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-visualizer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-agents-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HUB_URL": "http://localhost:4242",
        "AGENT_NAME": "Claude",
        "API_KEY": "your-key-from-env-file"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `4242` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `API_KEY` | *(none)* | Bearer token for write endpoints. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `*` | CORS origins (comma-separated) |
| `ALLOW_SIGNAL_PAYLOADS` | `false` | Allow data payloads in signals |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Set `true` if behind nginx/Cloudflare |

## Architecture

```
Agent 1 ──┐                                            ┌─ Property (tile grid)
Agent 2 ──┼── MCP/API ──► Hub Server ──► WebSocket ──► │  ├─ Desk (writing_code)
Agent 3 ──┘              (this repo)      broadcast    │  ├─ Bookshelf (reading)
                                                       │  └─ Whiteboard (planning)
                                                       └─ Viewer (browser)
```

- **Hub is the authority** — all agent state lives here
- **Viewers are pure renderers** — they just draw what the hub tells them
- **State maps to stations** — agent reports `writing_code`, character walks to the desk
- **Heartbeat cleanup** — agents not seen for 3 minutes are removed
- **Multi-agent** — multiple agents on different machines, all visible at once

## API

### Agent State
- `POST /api/state` — report agent state (requires auth)

### Property & Assets
- `GET /api/property` — get the current property
- `POST /api/assets` — add furniture (requires auth)
- `PATCH /api/assets/:id` — update asset position/content (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/assets/:id` — remove asset (requires auth)

### Boards
- `GET /api/board/:station` — read a station's board (public)
- `POST /api/board/:station` — post to a board (requires auth)

### Inboxes
- `POST /api/inbox` — send message to default inbox (requires auth)
- `POST /api/inbox/:name` — send to a named inbox (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/inbox/:name` — clear a named inbox (requires auth)

### Signals
- `POST /api/signals/fire` — fire a signal (requires auth)
- `POST /api/signals/set-interval` — change signal timing (requires auth)

### Status
- `GET /api/status` — property status overview
- `GET /api/health` — health check

## Security

- All write endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`
- Inbox messages are HTML-sanitized on input
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- CORS configurable via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- WebSocket viewers are read-only by default

## I Know You Didn't Read Any of That

Here. Just paste this into Claude and go back to vibing:

```
Install "The Agents" so I can watch you work as a little pixel character.

1. Run: docker run -p 4242:4242 zer0liquid/the-agents-hub:latest
2. Add this to .mcp.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-visualizer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-agents-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HUB_URL": "http://localhost:4242",
        "AGENT_NAME": "Claude"
      }
    }
  }
}
3. Open http://localhost:4242/viewer/ in a browser
4. Tell me when you're done so I can watch you walk around
5. MAKE NO MISTAKE
```

You're welcome. Now go open the viewer and pretend you understand what's happening.

## Don't dare to lauch a token. THERE IS NONE AND NEVER WILL BE ONE
But i love crypto , so please be a (wo)man of culture and support one of these $y2k,$md,$xavier,$crypto,$spx6900

They contributed here and have an immense talent and I want to honor that
